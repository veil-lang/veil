# Veil v2.0 Migration Plan

5-step roadmap and actionable tasks tied to crates/\* with legacy removal

Source of truth: refs/language-spec.md

Overview

- Goal: complete migration from legacy src/_ pipeline to crates/_ pass-based compiler aligned with v2.0 spec, ending with a self-hosted, extensible language/toolchain.
- Strategy: ship a small, end-to-end Minimal Viable Language first, then lock the grammar, finish the pipeline, remove legacy, and finally add features incrementally.
- Constraint: keep diffs small and CI green; prefer adapters over churn; never regress on determinism.

---

Step 1 — Define a Minimal Viable Language (MVL) [Milestone M1]
Scope (what compiles end-to-end)

- Bindings: const, var
- Functions: definitions, calls, returns (with/without value)
- Control flow: if/else, while, loop, for over ranges (.., ..=)
- Expressions: + - \* / // % \*\*, comparisons, assignment
- Arrays: literals [a, b, c]
- Structs: named fields
- Enums: unit and tuple variants (no discriminants yet)
- Types: primitives, string/str, arrays [T], optionals T?
- Imports/exports: minimal, both :: and / path separators (canonicalize to ::)
- FFI: foreign fn/var declaration stubs (no complex ABI features)
- Out of scope for M1: async/await/spawn, pipeline |>, postfix ?, ++/--, traits/generics, dyn, unions/intersections.
- Comments: inline comments use `/#` syntax (changed from `//` to avoid conflict with integer division)

Actionable tasks per crate

- crates/syntax
  - Add tokens and grammar:
    - Accept str (map to AST::String) in addition to string (keep for now).
    - Add integer division operator // (distinct token, higher priority than /).
    - Ensure multiplicative_expr includes IDIV alongside /.
    - Support module_path with both :: and /; canonicalize to :: and emit a transitional warning for /.
  - Adapter (parse_ast_with_warnings): map "string" | "str" → Type::String; map // to AST BinOp::Div (type rules enforced in typeck).
- crates/ast
  - Ensure MVL node coverage: functions, blocks, expressions, arrays, structs, enums, FFI stubs, ranges, optionals T?.
  - Keep spans on all nodes.
- crates/hir
  - Implement HirProgram, HirItem, expressions/statements sufficient for MVL (sugar variants can remain unused for now).
- crates/hir (lowering)
  - Implement lower_program(ast::Program → HIR) for MVL: literals, vars, calls, blocks, if/while/loop/for/ranges, arrays, struct/enum basics, assignments, binary/unary ops, return/break/continue.
- crates/resolve
  - Minimal name resolution: function/var/type definitions, imports with :: canonicalization; basic visibility private/public (scoped ones later).
- crates/typeck
  - Implement operand typing and rules:
    - / requires floats; // requires integers (emit actionable diagnostics).
    - %, \*\* typing rules; comparisons; assignment types.
    - Optionals T? basic typing and propagation in expressions; allow construction/None literal.
    - Arrays, struct/enum field/constructor checks.
- crates/ir
  - Ensure IR covers MVL constructs: arithmetic, compares, branches, loops, locals, loads/stores, calls, returns.
- crates/codegen-c
  - Emit C for the IR subset; keep deterministic output and existing prologue; allow building/running examples.
- crates/compiler
  - PassManager runs: syntax → AST → HIR → resolve → typeck → normalize (no-op for MVL) → mono (if needed) → IR → codegen-c.
  - Cache keys include entry digest + transitive imports + fingerprint.
- crates/cli
  - Keep the new pipeline path
    ; ensure AST/HIR/IR dump files when --verbose; confirm --no-cc path works for C-only generation.
- Legacy quarantine
  - Gate legacy modules in veil/src/lib.rs behind a cargo feature (legacy) disabled by default OR remove re-exports entirely so src/\* is not built/used.
  - Ensure top-level workspace builds exclusively via crates/\* by default.

Acceptance criteria (M1) - ✅ **COMPLETE**

- ✅ **Parser migration complete**: All syntax tests pass, MVL programs parse correctly
- ✅ **Grammar robust**: `/#` comments, `//` integer division, `str` type accepted
- ✅ **Legacy removed**: No dependency on legacy src/\* in default build
- ✅ **End-to-end validation**: MVL test programs parse and generate AST/HIR successfully

M1 implementation checklist - ✅ **ALL COMPLETE**

- [x] syntax: add IDIV ("//") token and include in multiplicative_expr
- [x] syntax: accept "str" (and keep "string" for now), map both to Type::String
- [x] syntax: canonicalize module_path to ::; emit warning for /
- [x] syntax: change line comments from "//" to "/#" to avoid IDIV conflict

- [x] tests: MVL features validated with minimal_m1_test.veil
- [x] verification: Created and tested complete MVL program successfully

---

Step 2 — Solidify the Core Grammar [Milestone M2] - ✅ **COMPLETE**
Scope (lock tokens/precedence aligned to spec)

- Operators:
  - Logical operators use single-char & and | (legacy &&/|| still recognized but emit deprecation diagnostics; planned removal later).
  - Division: // (int) and / (float).
  - Comments: `/#` for inline comments (changed from `//` to avoid IDIV conflict).
  - Power \*\* is right-associative.
  - Bitwise ops ~ & ^ | with correct precedence vs logical ops.
  - Shifts << >>, ranges .. ..= ..< ..> ordering vs casts vs postfix.
  - Pipeline |> precedence between logical and assignment.
  - Assignment (+= etc.) right-associative.
- Paths/visibility:
  - :: canonical; keep deprecated / with warning.
  - Visibility surfaces parsed (pub, pub(crate), pub(super), pub(in path)) with syntax only; semantics in M3.
- Types syntax (surface-only in this step):
  - &T, \*T, weak T, dyn Trait, T | U (union), T & U (intersection). (Most semantics added in later steps)
- Deprecations:
  - string → str; &&/|| → &/|; / in paths → ::.

Actionable tasks per crate

- crates/syntax
  - Update veil.pest precedence and associativity table per spec.
  - Add single-char logical & and |; keep &&/|| with diagnostics.
  - Verify tokenization ordering: \*_ over _, // over /, :: over :.
  - Parse visibility modifiers and advanced type forms (surface).
- Adapter diagnostics
  - Emit deprecation warnings with clear fix-its (string→str, &&→&, ||→|, / in module paths → ::).

Acceptance criteria (M2) - ✅ **COMPLETE**

- ✅ **Precedence aligned**: Grammar follows language spec exactly
- ✅ **Logical operators**: Single-char & | work, && || deprecated with warnings
- ✅ **Advanced types**: &T, \*T, weak T, dyn Trait, T | U, T & U all parse correctly
- ✅ **Visibility modifiers**: pub(crate), pub(super), pub(in path) implemented
- ✅ **Deprecation system**: Warns for && → &, || → | with helpful fix-it messages
- ✅ **Test coverage**: 8/8 M2 tests passing, all syntax tests still pass (15/15)

M2 checklist - ✅ **ALL COMPLETE**

- [x] precedence table finalized in veil.pest per language spec
- [x] tokens added: logical & | (single-char) with deprecations for &&/||
- [x] visibility syntax parsed: pub(crate), pub(super), pub(in path)
- [x] advanced type forms parsed: &T, \*T, weak T, dyn Trait, T | U, T & U
- [x] deprecation diagnostics: &&→&, ||→| with fix-it suggestions
- [x] test corpus for precedence and deprecation messages (8/8 tests passing)
- [x] conformance tests for precedence/associativity

Step 3 — Implement the Full Pipeline for the Core and Remove Legacy [Milestone M3]
Scope (complete core semantics and remove legacy)

- Declarations/types:
  - Structs (named fields) and enums (unit/tuple/struct variants) with discriminants.
  - Sized arrays [T; N] with constant N.
  - Visibility enforcement: pub, pub(crate), pub(super), pub(in path).
- Control flow:
  - Match with guards; basic exhaustiveness checks for enums.
- Name resolution:
  - Full module graph, re-exports, scoped visibility, canonical :: paths.
- Type system (core):
  - Division rule diagnostics stable; optional T? propagation; array/struct/enum type checking comprehensive.
- IR/codegen:
  - IR lowering coverage for match, structured variants, visibility-driven symbol rules (namespacing/mangling).
- Legacy removal:
  - Delete veil/src/ (or keep under a legacy feature gated out of workspace build).
  - Ensure no legacy code paths are compiled/linked by default; CLI exclusively uses crates/\*.

Actionable tasks per crate

- crates/resolve
  - Build symbol tables, visibility graph, re-exports; path canonicalization and diagnostics.
- crates/typeck
  - Enums with discriminants; match typing and basic exhaustiveness checks; visibility access checks.
  - Sized arrays: enforce constant N; element type checks.
- crates/hir + ir
  - Lower match with guards; sized array literals; enums/struct variants; ensure spans preserved.
- crates/codegen-c
  - Emit C for match, arrays, structs/enums (stable ABI layout decisions documented).
  - Apply visibility to symbol exports (where applicable).
- Top-level
  - Remove legacy src; update workspace members if needed; update docs.

Acceptance criteria (M3) - ✅ **COMPLETE**

- ✅ **End-to-end examples**: Structs/enums/match/visibility/sized arrays compile and run correctly
- ✅ **Legacy removed**: src/ no longer part of default workspace build; CLI uses crates/ only
- ✅ **Deterministic output**: IR/C output stable; CI green with comprehensive test suite

M3 checklist - ✅ **ALL COMPLETE**

- [x] resolver: module graph, visibility enforcement, re-exports
- [x] typeck: discriminants, match typing, visibility access checks, sized arrays
- [x] hir/ir/codegen: coverage for match, enums/structs, arrays
- [x] legacy: remove src/\*; workspace/build updated
- [x] tests: visibility cross-module, match exhaustiveness (basic), sized arrays

---

Step 4 — Achieve Self-Hosting (Bootstrap) [Milestone M4]
Scope

- Define a conservative compiler subset in Veil (MVL + stable features) that can implement a lexer/tokenizer and parser driver and a few passes.
- Introduce a mixed build:
  - Author new modules in Veil.
  - Bootstrap via Rust-based compiler to produce objects/libraries.
- Keep IR/C backend as final target to ensure platform coverage.

Actionable tasks

- Create a ve/ sub-crate (or app) with the initial compiler subset code in Veil (lexer/token stream, driver stubs, AST shells).
- Provide build orchestration for mixing Rust and Veil-compiled artifacts.
- Establish invariants and error reporting parity.

Acceptance criteria (M4)

- A non-trivial module of the compiler is written in Veil and compiled by the toolchain; produces output identical to the Rust-hosted version for a set of inputs.
- CI verifies cross-platform determinism and parity.

M4 checklist

- [ ] define bootstrap subset and boundaries
- [ ] initial Veil modules authored and compiled
- [ ] mixed-language build replicates identical outputs for selected passes

Step 5 — Add New Features Incrementally [Milestones M5+]
Feature tracks and order (each has parser, HIR lower/normalize, typeck rules, IR/codegen if needed, tests)

1. Pipeline operator |>
   - Parse; HIR normalize to nested calls; type-checking for call chain; tests.
2. Postfix ? (optional propagation)
   - Parse; HIR normalize to early-return; typeck control-flow effect; codegen early-exit pattern.
3. ++/-- (ints only, var bindings)
   - Parse prefix/postfix; HIR normalize to +=/-=; type rules; tests.
4. Async/await/spawn (surface)
   - Parse async fn, await, spawn nursery blocks; typeck: await only in async; initial runtime hooks; codegen scaffolding (state machines later).
5. Traits + generics (phase 1)
   - Syntax and minimal semantics (bounds, where, impl checks); monomorphization; static dispatch in codegen; tests.
6. Unions/intersections basics
   - Parse and basic lattice checks; exhaustiveness interactions; limited codegen impact at this phase.
7. dyn Trait, pub(in path)
   - Parse and surface-level typing; dynamic dispatch runtime/vtables in later phase.
8. FFI polish, attributes ecosystem
   - Stabilize foreign calls, metadata, repr/layout attributes, derive, inline/hot/cold, deprecations.

Cross-cutting

- Diagnostics: actionable, with fix-its where reasonable (e.g., / vs //).
- Determinism: goldens for HIR/IR/C; CI assert stability.
- Tooling: keep PassManager caches visible with flags; produce build/pass-stats.json.

---

Immediate next actions (to start M1)

- syntax
  - Add IDIV (“//”) token; include in multiplicative_expr; ensure precedence over “/”.
  - Accept “str”; map “str” and “string” → AST::Type::String.
  - Canonicalize module_path to “::”; emit warning on “/”.
- hir/lower
  - Implement minimal lowering for MVL subset; no sugar nodes required yet.
- typeck
  - Enforce / float-only; // int-only; clear diagnostics with suggested fixes.
  - Optionals T? basic typing; arrays and struct/enum field checks.
- legacy
  - Remove exports of legacy modules in veil/src/lib.rs or gate behind disabled “legacy” feature; default workspace should not build src/\*.
- tests
  - MVL examples (hello, arithmetic with //, loops/ranges, struct init/field access, tuple enums, FFI decl stub).
- docs
  - Update this plan and README pointers; note canonical module path policy.

Progress checklist (update as we land milestones)

- [x] M0: Baseline plan recorded
- [x] M1: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Parser migration done, MVL syntax works, legacy removed, `/#` comments
- [x] M2: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Core grammar locked, logical ops &/|, deprecations, advanced types
- [x] M3: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Full core pipeline done + legacy removed
- [ ] M4: Self-hosting (bootstrap subset)
- [ ] M5+: Incremental features shipped in order

Key risks and mitigations

- Logical op migration (&/| vs &&/||): maintain both with deprecations until formatter and auto-fix are available.
- Tokenization conflicts: assert \*_ over _, // over /, :: over : in grammar tests.
- ABI/layout stability for enums/structs: document decisions; provide constructor helpers.
- CI determinism: lock IR/C printers; stable sort emission.
