/# Minimal prelude for Veil standard library
/# This file is automatically imported by all Veil programs
/# Contains essential types and functions available by default

/# For M3 milestone, this is intentionally minimal to avoid dependencies
/# on other standard library modules that may not exist yet

/# Core types are built into the compiler and don't need explicit definitions here
/# i32, i64, f32, f64, bool, str, string, void are all built-in

/# Placeholder for future standard library exports
/# When the standard library is fully implemented, this file will export
/# commonly used functions, types, and traits
