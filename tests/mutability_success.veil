/# Test file for successful mutability cases in Veil v2.0

/# Test 1: Basic mutable variable assignment (should work)
fn test_mutable_assignment() {
    var x = 10;
    x = 20; /# This should be allowed
}

/# Test 2: Multiple assignments to mutable variable
fn test_multiple_assignments() {
    var counter = 0;
    counter = 1;
    counter = 2;
    counter = 3; /# All should work
}

/# Test 3: Mixed mutability - only assign to mutable ones
fn test_mixed_mutability() {
    var a = 1;
    var b = 2;
    const C = 3;

    a = 10; /# Should work - a is mutable
    /# Don't assign to b or C
}

/# Test 4: Mutable variable with type compatibility
fn test_type_compatible_assignment() {
    var x: i32 = 10;
    x = 20; /# Should work - same type
}

/# Test 5: Nested scope mutability
fn test_nested_scope() {
    var outer = 1;
    {
        var inner = 2;
        outer = 10; /# Should work
        inner = 20; /# Should work
    }
    outer = 30; /# Should work
}
