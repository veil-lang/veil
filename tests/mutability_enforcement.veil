/# Test file for mutability enforcement in Veil v2.0

/# Test 1: Basic mutable variable assignment (should work)
fn test_mutable_assignment() {
    var mut x = 10;
    x = 20; /# This should be allowed
}

/# Test 2: Immutable variable assignment (should fail)
fn test_immutable_assignment() {
    var x = 10;
    x = 20; /# This should cause a compile error
}

/# Test 3: Constant assignment (should fail)
fn test_constant_assignment() {
    const PI = 3.14159;
    PI = 3.14; /# This should cause a compile error
}

/# Test 4: Mixed mutability in same scope
fn test_mixed_mutability() {
    var mut a = 1;
    var b = 2;
    const C = 3;

    a = 10; /# Should work
    b = 20; /# Should fail
    C = 30; /# Should fail
}

/# Test 5: Mutable variable reassignment with type compatibility
fn test_type_compatible_assignment() {
    var mut x: i32 = 10;
    x = 20; /# Should work - same type
}

/# Test 6: Mutable variable with incompatible type (should fail type checking)
fn test_type_incompatible_assignment() {
    var mut x: i32 = 10;
    x = "hello"; /# Should fail - type mismatch
}

/# Test 7: Nested scope mutability
fn test_nested_scope() {
    var mut outer = 1;
    {
        var mut inner = 2;
        outer = 10; /# Should work
        inner = 20; /# Should work
    }
    outer = 30; /# Should work
    /# inner = 40; /# Should fail - out of scope
}

/# Test 8: Function parameters (immutable by default)
fn test_parameter_mutability(x: i32) {
    x = 10; /# Should fail - parameters are immutable
}

/# Test 9: Multiple assignments to mutable variable
fn test_multiple_assignments() {
    var mut counter = 0;
    counter = 1;
    counter = 2;
    counter = 3; /# All should work
}
