# Veil language test suite (v2.0, implemented subset)

Purpose
- This directory hosts .veil programs that validate every feature currently implemented in the parser/AST/HIR/typecheck pipeline.
- Tests are discovered by `test <name> { ... }` blocks in .veil files. Each test compiles independently; success = program compiles.

How to run
- List tests: veil test veil/tests --list
- Run all: veil test veil/tests
- Run one: veil test veil/tests --test-name <name>
- Verbose: add --verbose

Conventions
- One topic per file; multiple test blocks per file.
- Keep everything a test uses inside its block (no reliance on other tests).
- Prefer primitives and simple expressions (the runner compiles but does not execute assertions yet).
- Prelude is auto-injected. Avoid extra imports unless necessary.

Planned files and reference content
- Copy/paste each block below into the corresponding file under veil/tests/

Whatâ€™s covered (implemented subset)
- Lexical: identifiers, comments (/# ... #/), literals (int, float, string, bool, none), template strings
- Types: primitive aliases (i8/i16/i32/i64/u32/f32/f64/str/string/void/any), arrays [T] and [T; N], optional parsing path (T?) at grammar level
- Expressions: unary (!, +, -, ++/-- prefix and postfix), binary (+, -, *, /, //, %, ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, &, |, &&, ||), casts (as), array indexing, field access shape, calls (f(...)), template strings, ranges (.., ..=, ..>, ..<), match, if, loop
- Statements: let/var, expr, return, while, for, loop, blocks
- Decls: fn, struct, enum (unit/tuple, discriminants), exports (pub, pub(crate), pub(super), pub(in path))
- Imports: import all and normalization (:: vs /), auto prelude injection

Notes
- Keep tests conservative to avoid unimplemented semantics (e.g., complex method dispatch, advanced trait objects, raw pointers).
- This suite validates end-to-end compilation in the current pipeline; functional assertions can be added once runtime execution is wired in the test runner.
