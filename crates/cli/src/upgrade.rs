//! Upgrade subcommand for package management (placeholder)

//! This module will handle upgrading ve packages and dependencies in the future.

///
/// This command is intended for upgrading ve packages and dependencies,
/// not the toolchain itself. For toolchain updates, use `ve update`.
///
/// Arguments:
/// - `no_remind`: Disable future upgrade reminders (planned feature).
/// - `force`: Proceed without confirmation (planned feature).
/// - `verbose`: Print extra information (planned feature).
/// - `channel`: Selected update channel for packages (planned feature).

         Package management features will be available in a future release."
