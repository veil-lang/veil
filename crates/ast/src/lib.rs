//! Veil AST facade crate
//!
//! Purpose
//! - Provide a temporary facade that exposes the existing AST from the root compiler crate,
//!   so new workspace crates (e.g., `syntax`) can depend on a stable `veil-ast` crate
//!   while we migrate code into dedicated pass crates.
//!
//! Behavior
//! - By default (no special feature flags), this crate includes the root AST source file
//!   directly via `include!`, so downstream users can `use veil_ast::*` and obtain the same
//!   types currently defined in `veil/src/ast.rs`.
//! - Optionally, with the `reexport-root` Cargo feature enabled, this crate will instead
//!   re-export the root crate’s AST module (`ve::ast::*`). This can be useful when the
//!   include-path approach is undesirable on a particular setup.
//!
//! Migration path
//! - Once the AST is moved into this crate for real, the `include!` and `reexport-root` paths
//!   will be removed and the types will live natively here.

/// Re-export the root crate AST (`ve::ast::*`) when the `reexport-root` feature is enabled.
/// This avoids textual inclusion but requires the root crate to be a build-time dependency
/// and may create a cycle if the root crate depends back on `veil-ast`.
#[cfg(feature = "reexport-root")]
pub use ve::ast::*;

/// Default path: include the current root AST source directly.
///
/// Notes:
/// - This uses an absolute path computed from this crate’s manifest directory to reach
///   the root `src/ast.rs`.
/// - The included source will be compiled in the context of this crate. Ensure that any
///   dependencies used by the AST (e.g., `codespan`) are also available to this crate.
///
/// If you encounter path issues on your platform, enable the `reexport-root` feature
/// as a temporary workaround.
pub mod ast;
pub use ast::*;

/// A small sanity test to ensure the facade compiles and exposes at least one well-known type.
/// This uses conditional compilation because the actual exposed items come from the included
/// or re-exported root source.
#[cfg(test)]
mod facade_tests {
    // We cannot name specific types here beyond trivial compile checks because they come
    // from the included root source file. Instead, we just ensure the crate compiles and
    // at least one commonly known symbol path resolves in typical setups.

    #[test]
    fn facade_compiles() {
        // If the AST defines a common type like `Type` (as in the current root AST),
        // try to reference it. This test is intentionally light-touch to avoid breaking
        // if the root AST evolves during migration.
